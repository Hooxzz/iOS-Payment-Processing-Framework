Getting started 🚀
This section helps you start quickly. The goal is a clean setup that's easy to scale.

Prerequisites
- iOS 13+ or later
- Xcode 14+ (or your preferred modern Xcode)
- Swift Package Manager capable project or an Xcode project that supports Swift packages
- Reasonable networking access for live environments (sandbox is provided)

1) Install the package
- In Xcode, add the package URL and pick a version you need (ideally the latest). The package URL is the repository itself.

2) Import and configure
- Import the module in your app code.
- Create a configuration object with your merchant and environment information.
- Create a payment gateway instance and use it to start a payment flow.

3) Run a sample flow
- Use a sample merchant ID, test keys, and sandbox endpoints to validate flows in a safe environment.

Swift Package Manager installation
- In your Package.swift, add the package dependency:
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Hooxzz/iOS-Payment-Processing-Framework.git", from: "1.0.0")
  ]
- In your target, add the product:
  .target(
    name: "YourApp",
    dependencies: ["IOSPaymentProcessingFramework"] // depends on your module name
  )
- Open Xcode, resolve packages, and build.

Tip: Use semantic versioning constraints to keep your app stable. For example, from: "1.0.0" ensures you receive minor and patch updates but avoids breaking changes from major bumps.

Quick start examples
- Basic payment flow
  import IOSPaymentProcessingFramework

  let config = PaymentConfig(
      merchantId: "merchant.example",
      environment: .sandbox,
      apiKey: "test_api_key_123"
  )

  let gateway = PaymentGateway(config: config)

  gateway.startPayment(amount: 9.99, currency: "USD", method: .applePay) { result in
      switch result {
      case .success(let transaction):
          print("Payment succeeded: \(transaction.id)")
      case .failure(let error):
          print("Payment failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
      }
  }

- Card payment example
  gateway.processPayment(amount: 19.99, currency: "USD", method: .card(cardDetails: CardDetails(number: "4242424242424242", expiry: "1225", cvc: "123"))) { result in
      // handle result
  }

- Apple Pay example
  gateway.processPayment(amount: 5.00, currency: "USD", method: .applePay) { result in
      // handle result
  }

- Wallet and bank transfer example
  gateway.processPayment(amount: 12.50, currency: "USD", method: .wallet(walletType: .appleWallet)) { result in
      // handle result
  }

- Fraud check example (before finishing a payment)
  let risk = FraudEngine.check(transaction: transaction)
  if risk.score > 0.7 {
      // flag or escalate
  }
